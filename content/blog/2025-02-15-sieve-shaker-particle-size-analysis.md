Sieve analysis is a fundamental technique for determining particle size distribution in pharmaceutical and industrial applications.

## Sieve Analysis Fundamentals

### Principle

Particles are separated by passing through a series of sieves with progressively smaller mesh openings. Material retained on each sieve represents a size fraction.

### Sieve Construction

Sieves consist of fine wires of stainless steel, brass, or copper woven into meshes with precise aperture sizes.

## Method Steps

### Sample Preparation

1. Obtain representative sample
2. Dry if necessary
3. Break up aggregates without crushing particles
4. Weigh sample accurately

### Sieve Stack Assembly

1. Arrange sieves in order (largest aperture on top)
2. Place sample on top sieve
3. Secure lid
4. Mount on sieve shaker

### Shaking

1. Set appropriate amplitude and duration
2. Start shaker
3. Run for specified time
4. Allow system to stop completely

### Weighing

1. Carefully remove each sieve
2. Weigh retained material
3. Calculate percentages

## Result Interpretation

### Size Distribution

Plot cumulative percentage vs. sieve size to visualize distribution.

### Key Metrics

- D10, D50, D90 values
- Mean particle size
- Span (distribution width)

## Quality Control Applications

### Granulation Monitoring

Verify granule size meets specifications for tableting.

### Excipient Qualification

Confirm incoming materials meet particle size requirements.

### Process Control

Monitor manufacturing processes affecting particle size.

## Best Practices

### Sample Size

Use appropriate sample mass for sieve diameter and material density.

### Shaking Time

Optimize to achieve complete separation without particle breakage.

### Sieve Maintenance

Regular cleaning and calibration verification ensure accurate results.
