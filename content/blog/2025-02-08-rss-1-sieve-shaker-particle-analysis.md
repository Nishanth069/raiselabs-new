The RSS-1 Electromagnetic Sieve Shaker from Raise Lab Equipment is designed for laboratories requiring precision particle size analysis.

## Key Specifications

### Sieve Capacity

- 100×25 mm sieves: Up to 16 sieves
- 200×50 mm sieves: Up to 8 sieves

### Amplitude Range

Adjustable from 0.5 to 3.0 mm to accommodate different materials and particle sizes.

### Vibration Frequency

Operating at 3,000-3,600 vibrations per minute for efficient separation.

## Features for Accuracy

### Consistent Vibration

Electromagnetic drive ensures every analysis receives identical shaking conditions, eliminating variability.

### Calibrated Sieves

Sieves supplied with individual calibration certificates confirm aperture accuracy.

### Programmable Controls

Digital controls allow precise setting of:

- Analysis duration
- Amplitude level
- Interval timing

## Applications

### Pharmaceutical

- Granulation monitoring
- Excipient qualification
- Stability studies
- Quality control testing

### Food Industry

- Ingredient sizing
- Product consistency
- Process control

### Materials Science

- Powder characterization
- Research applications
- Process development

## Wet and Dry Sieving

The RSS-1 handles both methods:

### Dry Sieving

For free-flowing powders and granules that separate easily without liquid assistance.

### Wet Sieving

Using specialized accessories for:

- Materials that clump
- Powders with static charge
- Fine particles requiring liquid suspension

## Compliance

The RSS-1 meets requirements of international standards for particle size analysis, providing documented, traceable results suitable for regulatory submissions.
