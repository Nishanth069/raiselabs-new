Raise Lab's RMP-1 is a precision instrument for accurate measurements of melting and boiling points, capable of handling temperatures from ambient to 320°C.

## Key Specifications

- **Temperature Range**: Ambient to 320°C
- **Capillary Capacity**: Three melting point capillary tubes and one boiling point capillary
- **Built-in Stirrer**: Ensures even temperature circulation throughout the medium
- **Heating Element**: Immersed W-shaped bulb for uniform heating
- **Temperature Control**: Adjustable transformer enabling stepless regulation of heating current

## Applications

### Melting Point Determination

Melting point is a fundamental physical property used to:

- Identify unknown compounds
- Assess purity of substances (sharp melting point indicates high purity)
- Quality control of raw materials and finished products

### Boiling Point Determination

Boiling point testing is essential for:

- Characterizing volatile compounds
- Quality assessment of solvents
- Verification of chemical identity

## Operating Principle

The apparatus uses an oil bath or suitable medium heated by an immersed heating element. The stirrer ensures uniform temperature distribution. Samples in capillary tubes are observed through a magnifying lens as temperature gradually increases.

## Precision Features

- **Stepless Temperature Control**: Fine adjustments for accurate heating rates
- **Clear Observation**: Magnifying lens and proper illumination
- **Even Heating**: Stirrer prevents hot spots and ensures accurate readings

The RMP-1 is essential for any pharmaceutical, chemical, or research laboratory requiring accurate melting and boiling point data.
