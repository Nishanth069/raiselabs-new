Dissolution testing is integral to pharmaceutical development, from early formulation through commercial manufacturing.

## Role in Development Stages

### Preformulation

Dissolution studies help:

- Characterize drug solubility
- Identify potential formulation challenges
- Guide excipient selection

### Formulation Development

Testing enables:

- Optimization of release profiles
- Comparison of formulation alternatives
- Establishment of in vitro-in vivo correlations

### Scale-Up

Dissolution testing verifies:

- Consistent performance at larger batch sizes
- Process parameter effects
- Equipment transfer success

### Commercial Manufacturing

Routine testing ensures:

- Batch-to-batch consistency
- Specification compliance
- Stability throughout shelf life

## Bioequivalence Applications

### Generic Development

Dissolution testing supports:

- Demonstration of similarity to reference product
- Biowaiver applications where appropriate
- Regulatory submissions

### IVIVC Development

In vitro-in vivo correlation allows:

- Prediction of clinical performance
- Reduced need for human studies
- Efficient formulation optimization

## Regulatory Expectations

### Specification Development

Dissolution specifications must be:

- Scientifically justified
- Clinically relevant
- Achievable in manufacturing

### Stability Testing

Dissolution is a key stability indicator, monitoring:

- Changes over time
- Storage condition effects
- Package integrity

## Quality by Design

Modern development incorporates dissolution testing in:

- Design space definition
- Control strategy development
- Continuous process verification

## Advanced Applications

### Biorelevant Media

Media simulating GI conditions improve:

- In vivo prediction
- Food effect assessment
- Formulation optimization

### Real-Time Release

Dissolution data may support:

- Parametric release
- Reduced end-product testing
- Faster batch release
