Package integrity testing is critical for ensuring pharmaceutical products remain protected throughout their shelf life.

## Why Package Integrity Matters

### Product Protection

Packaging must protect against:

- Moisture ingress
- Oxygen exposure
- Microbial contamination
- Light degradation

### Regulatory Requirements

Regulatory agencies require demonstration of package integrity for:

- Product registration
- Stability studies
- Batch release

## Testing Methods

### Vacuum Decay (Dye Test)

The most common method for flexible packaging:

1. Samples placed in dye solution
2. Vacuum applied
3. Air exits through any leaks
4. Vacuum released, dye enters faulty packages
5. Visual inspection for dye penetration

### Bubble Emission

Packages submerged and vacuum applied. Bubbles indicate leak location.

### Pressure Decay

Sealed packages pressurized, pressure monitored for decay indicating leaks.

### Visual Inspection

Examination for obvious defects:

- Seal integrity
- Punctures or tears
- Material defects

## Equipment: RLT-1 Leak Test Apparatus

### Features

- Microprocessor controlled vacuum
- Digital pressure display
- Programmable test parameters
- Robust desiccator construction

### Applications

Testing of:

- Blister packs
- Strip packaging
- Sachets
- Pouches

## Test Parameters

### Vacuum Level

Typically -15 to -25 inches Hg depending on package type.

### Hold Time

Duration under vacuum, usually 30-60 seconds.

### Dye Selection

Methylene Blue commonly used for visibility.

## Documentation

Records must include:

- Test parameters used
- Sample identification
- Results (pass/fail)
- Inspector signature
