Validation of dissolution test apparatus is essential for ensuring accurate and reproducible pharmaceutical testing results.

## Validation Components

### Installation Qualification (IQ)

Verify that equipment is properly installed:

- Correct electrical connections
- Proper environmental conditions
- All components present and functional
- Documentation complete

### Operational Qualification (OQ)

Demonstrate equipment operates correctly:

- Temperature control accuracy
- Rotation speed verification
- Wobble testing
- Timer accuracy

### Performance Qualification (PQ)

Prove equipment performs consistently:

- Testing with reference standards
- Multi-day reproducibility studies
- Comparison with other qualified equipment

## Key Parameters to Validate

### Mechanical Parameters

- Shaft wobble (< 1mm runout)
- Rotation speed accuracy (±4%)
- Vessel centering
- Paddle/basket height

### Temperature Parameters

- Bath temperature uniformity
- Vessel temperature accuracy
- Temperature recovery time

### Timing Parameters

- Timer accuracy
- Sampling interval precision

## Performance Verification Testing (PVT)

PVT uses USP reference standards to verify system performance:

- Prednisone tablets (sensitive to hydrodynamics)
- Salicylic acid tablets (robust standard)

Results must fall within established acceptance criteria.

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain complete records of:

- Validation protocols and results
- Calibration certificates
- Maintenance logs
- Change control documentation

## Ongoing Verification

Regular verification ensures continued compliance:

- Daily temperature checks
- Periodic rotation speed verification
- Annual revalidation
- After repairs or modifications
