In the pharmaceutical industry, packaging is the final barrier between the drug and the environment. If a blister pack, strip, or sachet has a microscopic leak, moisture and oxygen can enter, leading to chemical degradation, physical changes, or microbial contamination.

## Why Leak Testing is Mandatory

A compromised package seal can cause:

- **Chemical Degradation**: Reducing API potency
- **Physical Changes**: Softening of tablets or clumping of powders
- **Microbial Contamination**: Compromising product safety

## The Vacuum Decay Method

The most common and effective method for testing flexible packaging:

1. **Preparation**: Samples placed in a desiccator jar filled with colored dye solution (usually Methylene Blue)
2. **Vacuum Application**: The Leak Test Apparatus creates controlled vacuum inside the jar
3. **Pressure Differential**: If there is a hole, the air inside is sucked out
4. **Observation**: When vacuum is released, dye solution is drawn into faulty packages
5. **Inspection**: Blue staining indicates a failed seal

## Features of the RLT-1 Leak Test Apparatus

- **Microprocessor Control**: Ensures exact vacuum levels are reached and maintained
- **Digital Display**: Real-time monitoring of vacuum pressure and hold time
- **Robust Desiccator**: High-quality polycarbonate jars, easy to clean
- **Programmable Methods**: Store multiple testing protocols for different product lines

The RLT-1 offers an economical, fully calibrated solution for ensuring integrity of various packaging types.
