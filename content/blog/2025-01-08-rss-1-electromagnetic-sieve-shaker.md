The Raise Lab Equipment Electromagnetic Sieve Shaker Model RSS-1 is a pivotal tool in laboratories for particle size analysis with precision, efficiency, and compliance.

## Operating Principles

Electromagnetic sieve shakers operate using electromagnetic waves to create vibrations. An electromagnetic drive unit converts electrical energy into mechanical vibrations, generating a controlled and consistent pattern. The drive creates vibrations by oscillating at high frequency, typically between 3,000 and 3,600 vibrations per minute.

## Key Specifications

- Sieves constructed from high-quality Stainless Steel-316 (SS-316) for durability and corrosion resistance
- Available in sizes of 100mm and 200mm diameter with heights of 25mm and 50mm
- Adjustable amplitude ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 mm
- Accommodates 100×25 mm sieves (up to 16 sieves) and 200×50 mm sieves (up to 8 sieves)

## Advantages Over Traditional Shakers

- **Improved Separation Efficiency**: Consistent, precise shaking motion enhances accuracy
- **Reduced Sample Loss**: Better particle control during analysis
- **Faster Analysis Times**: High-frequency vibration speeds up separation
- **Greater Reproducibility**: Electronic control ensures consistent results
- **Low Maintenance**: Fewer moving parts than mechanical shakers
- **Quiet Operation**: Minimal noise improves laboratory environment

## Wet vs. Dry Sieving

The RSS-1 handles both common sieving methods:

- **Dry Sieving**: For free-flowing materials like granules and coarse powders
- **Wet Sieving**: Essential for materials that clump or carry static charge, with specialized kit including spray nozzle

## Regulatory Compliance

Sieves supplied with the RSS-1 conform to stringent industry standards with individual calibration certificates ensuring accuracy and consistency.
