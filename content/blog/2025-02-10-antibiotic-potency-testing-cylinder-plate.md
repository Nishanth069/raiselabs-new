The cylinder-plate (cup-plate) diffusion assay is a standard method for determining antibiotic potency used worldwide in pharmaceutical quality control.

## Method Principle

### Agar Diffusion

When an antibiotic solution is placed in cylinders on an inoculated agar surface, the antibiotic diffuses into the agar. If the test organism is susceptible, a clear zone forms where bacterial growth is inhibited.

### Zone Diameter Relationship

The diameter of the inhibition zone is proportional to the logarithm of the antibiotic concentration, allowing potency calculation.

## Procedure Overview

### Preparation

1. Prepare base layer of sterile agar
2. Add seed layer inoculated with test organism
3. Allow to solidify
4. Place sterile cylinders on agar surface
5. Add standard and sample solutions to cylinders

### Incubation

Plates are incubated at appropriate temperature (usually 35-37°C) for specified time (typically 16-18 hours).

### Reading

Zone diameters are measured using an Antibiotic Zone Reader for accuracy and precision.

## Critical Parameters

### Test Organism Selection

Specific organisms are specified for each antibiotic type:

- Micrococcus luteus for penicillins
- Bacillus subtilis for many antibiotics
- Staphylococcus aureus for certain assays

### Medium Preparation

Exact composition, pH, and depth of agar layers affect diffusion and zone formation.

### Standard Curves

Multiple concentration levels of reference standard establish the dose-response relationship.

## Pharmacopeial Compliance

Methods align with:

- USP <81> Antibiotics—Microbial Assays
- BP Appendix XIV
- EP 2.7.2
- JP antibiotic assay methods

## Zone Reading Technology

The Antibiotic Zone Reader provides:

- High resolution measurement (0.01 mm)
- Uniform illumination
- Reduced operator variability
- Digital recording of results
