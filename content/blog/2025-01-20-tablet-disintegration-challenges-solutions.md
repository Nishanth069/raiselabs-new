Tablet disintegration testing can present various challenges that affect result accuracy and reliability. Understanding these challenges and their solutions is key to successful quality control.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Floating Tablets

**Problem**: Some tablets float on the dissolution medium, preventing proper testing.

**Solution**: Use disks to keep tablets submerged. Ensure disks meet USP specifications for weight and dimensions.

### Incomplete Disintegration

**Problem**: Tablets may leave residues or large fragments.

**Solutions**:
- Verify medium temperature is correct
- Check basket mesh for clogging
- Review formulation for appropriate disintegrant levels

### Temperature Fluctuations

**Problem**: Inconsistent medium temperature affects results.

**Solutions**:
- Allow adequate equilibration time before testing
- Verify heater calibration
- Check ambient temperature conditions

### Gelling or Sticking

**Problem**: Some formulations form gels or stick to equipment.

**Solutions**:
- Consider alternative dissolution media
- Adjust test conditions as allowed by specifications
- Clean equipment thoroughly between tests

## Optimization Tips

### Medium Selection

Choose appropriate medium based on:

- Product pH requirements
- Solubility characteristics
- Pharmacopeial specifications

### Equipment Maintenance

Regular maintenance prevents many common problems:

- Daily temperature verification
- Weekly basket inspection
- Monthly stroke rate calibration
- Annual full calibration

### Environmental Controls

Maintain consistent laboratory conditions:

- Temperature: 20-25°C
- Humidity: Controlled to prevent sample moisture changes
- Clean, organized workspace

## Troubleshooting Guide

Document and investigate any recurring issues. Maintain logs of equipment performance and test failures to identify patterns and root causes.
