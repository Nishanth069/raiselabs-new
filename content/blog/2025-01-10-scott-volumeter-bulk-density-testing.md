Bulk density is the ratio of the mass of an untapped powder sample to its volume, including inter-particulate void volume. For fine, light, or non-free-flowing powders, standard pouring methods are inaccurate.

## The Science of the Scott Volumeter

The Scott Volumeter (also known as Paint and Pigment Volumeter) eliminates human error and ensures standardized powder loading.

### How it Works

1. **Funnel Loading**: Powder is poured into the top funnel
2. **Baffle System**: Powder falls through glass baffles in a zig-zag pattern, breaking up clumps and ensuring uniform speed
3. **Collection Cup**: Powder falls into a 1-cubic-inch or 25 mL collection cup of known volume
4. **Leveling**: Excess powder is carefully leveled off with a spatula
5. **Calculation**: Weight of powder in cup is measured for bulk density calculation

## Why Use a Scott Volumeter?

- **Consistency**: Baffle system ensures powder is not compacted by weight or pour force
- **Standardization**: Meets requirements of ASTM B329 (Standard Test Method for Apparent Density of Metal Powders)
- **Versatility**: Ideal for metal powders, pharmaceutical excipients, pigments, and chemicals

## Key Components of Raise Lab Scott Volumeter

- **Stainless Steel Construction**: Durable and easy to decontaminate
- **Precision Glass Baffles**: Clear visibility of powder flow
- **Calibrated Collection Cups**: High-precision manufacturing for exact volume measurements

The Scott Volumeter follows USP <616> Method 2, EP <2.9.34-2>, DIN ISO <3923-2>, GOST <19440-94>, and ASTM B329 standards.
