21 CFR Part 11 establishes FDA requirements for electronic records and electronic signatures, critical for pharmaceutical analytical instruments.

## Key Requirements

### Electronic Records

Systems must ensure:

- Records are accurate and complete
- Records cannot be altered without detection
- Records are readily available for review

### Electronic Signatures

Requirements include:

- Unique to individual users
- Cannot be reused or reassigned
- Linked to corresponding records

## System Controls

### Access Control

- Unique user IDs and passwords
- Role-based access levels
- Password policies and expiration
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Audit Trails

Systems must maintain:

- Date and time stamps
- User identification
- Actions performed
- Before and after values for changes

### Data Integrity

Ensure:

- No unauthorized modifications
- Complete record retention
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Instrument-Specific Considerations

### Dissolution Testers

- Temperature and speed parameter logging
- Test result integrity
- Method storage and retrieval

### Hardness Testers

- Force measurement records
- Statistical calculation verification
- Data export security

### Disintegration Testers

- Timing records
- Temperature monitoring data
- Pass/fail documentation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Gap Assessment**: Evaluate current systems against requirements
2. **System Selection**: Choose compliant equipment
3. **Validation**: Demonstrate system meets requirements
4. **Training**: Ensure users understand requirements
5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Maintain compliance over time

## Documentation

Maintain:

- Validation protocols and reports
- User training records
- SOP documentation
- Audit trail reports
