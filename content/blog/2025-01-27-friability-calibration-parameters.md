Proper calibration of tablet friability testers ensures accurate assessment of tablet mechanical strength according to pharmacopeial requirements.

## Key Calibration Parameters

### Rotation Speed

The drum must rotate at a fixed speed of 25 ± 1 rpm:

- Use a calibrated tachometer to measure speed
- If speed deviates, adjust motor controller
- Verify at beginning and during rotation cycle

### Fall Height

The tablets must fall from a consistent height:

- Measured using a scale or gauge
- Must align with 6.3 ± 0.2 mm standard
- Check drum interior for wear or damage

### Rotation Count

Standard test requires exactly 100 rotations:

- Verify counter accuracy
- Test timer correlation (4 minutes at 25 rpm)
- Check for consistent counting

### Drum Condition

Inspect drum for:

- Cracks or chips
- Internal surface smoothness
- Proper mounting and balance

## Calibration Procedure

1. **Visual Inspection**: Check drum and drive system
2. **Speed Verification**: Measure rotation speed with tachometer
3. **Count Verification**: Confirm accurate rotation counting
4. **Height Check**: Verify fall height specification
5. **Timer Verification**: Compare to calibrated stopwatch
6. **Documentation**: Record all measurements

## Acceptance Criteria

Per USP <1216>:

- Rotation speed: 25 ± 1 rpm
- Test duration: 100 rotations
- Weight loss limit: Typically <1%

## Maintenance

- Keep drum clean and free of tablet residue
- Check drive belt tension regularly
- Verify interlock safety systems
- Clean and inspect regularly
