The Scott Volumeter is a specialized instrument for measuring the bulk density of powders that cannot be accurately measured by simple pouring methods.

## When to Use a Scott Volumeter

### Problem Materials

Standard pour methods fail for:

- Fine powders
- Light, fluffy materials
- Non-free-flowing powders
- Materials sensitive to handling

### Why Standard Methods Fail

Pouring fine powders results in:

- Inconsistent packing
- Variable results between operators
- Density affected by pour height and speed

## The Scott Volumeter Solution

### Design Principle

The Scott Volumeter uses a baffle system that:

- Breaks up powder clumps
- Controls fall rate
- Standardizes loading into collection cup

### How It Works

1. Powder enters top funnel
2. Falls through glass baffles in zigzag pattern
3. Clumps are broken up
4. Powder enters cup at constant rate
5. Collection cup filled without compaction

## Standards Compliance

The Scott Volumeter meets requirements of:

- USP <616> Method 2
- EP <2.9.34-2>
- DIN ISO <3923-2>
- GOST <19440-94>
- ASTM B329

## Applications

### Pharmaceutical

- Excipient characterization
- API bulk density
- Formulation development

### Other Industries

- Metal powders
- Pigments
- Chemicals
- Food ingredients

## Raise Lab RSV-1 Features

- Stainless steel construction
- Precision glass baffles
- Calibrated collection cups
- Easy cleaning and decontamination

## Importance in Quality Control

Accurate bulk density data ensures:

- Consistent manufacturing
- Proper equipment sizing
- Accurate batch calculations
- Regulatory compliance
