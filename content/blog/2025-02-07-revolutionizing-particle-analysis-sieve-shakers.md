Understanding the science behind electromagnetic sieve shakers reveals why they deliver superior particle analysis results.

## Electromagnetic Drive Principles

### Energy Conversion

An electromagnetic drive unit converts electrical energy into mechanical vibrations through electromagnetic field interactions.

### Controlled Oscillation

The drive creates oscillations at high frequency, generating consistent vibration patterns that can be precisely controlled.

### Three-Dimensional Motion

Unlike simple up-down or circular motions, electromagnetic shakers create complex three-dimensional movement that optimizes particle separation.

## Particle Separation Science

### Stratification

Vibration causes particles to stratify by size, with smaller particles moving toward the sieve surface.

### Passage Probability

Each vibration cycle gives particles opportunities to pass through appropriately sized mesh openings.

### Preventing Blinding

Interval timing and amplitude control help prevent mesh blinding by dislodging near-size particles.

## Sieve Construction

### Material

Sieves are typically constructed from high-quality Stainless Steel-316 (SS-316) for:

- Durability
- Corrosion resistance
- Easy cleaning
- No sample contamination

### Mesh Specifications

Sieves conform to stringent industry standards with individual calibration certificates ensuring:

- Accurate aperture sizes
- Consistent wire diameters
- Proper weave patterns

## Optimization Parameters

### Amplitude

Adjustable amplitude (0.5-3.0 mm) allows optimization for:

- Different particle sizes
- Various material densities
- Specific separation requirements

### Time

Programmable duration ensures:

- Complete separation
- Reproducible results
- Efficient analysis

### Interval Settings

Burst modes help:

- Prevent mesh clogging
- Improve fine powder separation
- Handle difficult materials

## Quality Control Applications

In pharmaceutical applications, electromagnetic sieve shakers:

- Size granules for tablet production
- Verify excipient specifications
- Support formulation development
- Enable stability studies
