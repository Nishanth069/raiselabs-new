The USP specifies different types of dissolution apparatuses based on the characteristics of the drug product being tested.

## USP Apparatus 1 - Basket Method

The basket method uses a cylindrical basket made of stainless steel mesh that holds the dosage form while rotating in the dissolution medium.

**Best suited for:**
- Capsules
- Floating dosage forms
- Beads and pellets
- Products that tend to disintegrate into large particles

## USP Apparatus 2 - Paddle Method

The most commonly used method featuring a paddle that rotates in the dissolution vessel creating gentle agitation.

**Best suited for:**
- Immediate-release tablets
- Most solid oral dosage forms
- Suspensions

## USP Apparatus 5 - Paddle Over Disk

Used primarily for transdermal patches where the product is held at the bottom of the vessel by a disk assembly.

**Best suited for:**
- Transdermal patches
- Medicated plasters

## USP Apparatus 6 - Cylinder Method

Features a cylinder assembly for holding transdermal systems.

**Best suited for:**
- Transdermal therapeutic systems
- Large transdermal patches

## Intrinsic Dissolution Testing

Measures the dissolution rate of a pure drug substance compacted into a non-disintegrating disk. This provides information about the drug's intrinsic properties independent of formulation factors.

## Selecting the Right Method

The choice of apparatus depends on:

- Dosage form characteristics
- Drug release mechanism
- Regulatory requirements
- Historical data and bioequivalence considerations
