Antibiotic potency testing is governed by several major pharmacopeias, each with specific requirements and methodologies.

## USP Requirements

### General Chapter <81>

The United States Pharmacopeia provides comprehensive guidance for microbial assays of antibiotics including:

- Test organism specifications
- Medium preparation requirements
- Zone measurement procedures
- Potency calculation methods

## BP Requirements

### Appendix XIV

The British Pharmacopeia specifies:

- Biological assay procedures
- Reference standard requirements
- Statistical analysis methods
- Acceptance criteria

## EP Requirements

### Section 2.7.2

The European Pharmacopeia details:

- Microbiological assay of antibiotics
- Agar diffusion methods
- Turbidimetric procedures
- Validation requirements

## JP Requirements

The Japanese Pharmacopeia provides:

- Country-specific test organisms
- Medium compositions
- Calculation methods
- Quality specifications

## Common Elements

### Zone Measurement

All pharmacopeias require accurate zone diameter measurement. The Antibiotic Zone Reader ensures compliance with:

- High precision (0.01 mm resolution)
- Consistent measurement technique
- Documented results

### Statistical Analysis

Parallel line or slope ratio calculations are used to determine potency relative to reference standards.

### Documentation

All methods require complete records of:

- Standard and sample preparations
- Zone measurements
- Calculations and results
- Analyst identification

## Choosing the Right Method

Selection depends on:

- Market requirements
- Regulatory submissions
- Available reference standards
- Laboratory capabilities
