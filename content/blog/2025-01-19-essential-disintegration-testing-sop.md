A well-written Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for disintegration testing is essential for ensuring consistent, compliant results in pharmaceutical quality control.

## Key SOP Components

### Purpose and Scope

Clearly define what the SOP covers, including applicable dosage forms and test methods.

### Equipment Requirements

- Disintegration apparatus meeting USP/IP specifications
- Calibrated thermometers
- Timer with accuracy to seconds
- Appropriate beakers for medium preparation

### Medium Preparation

Specify:

- Composition of disintegration medium
- Preparation instructions
- Temperature requirements (37°C ± 2°C)
- Volume requirements

### Test Procedure

Step-by-step instructions including:

1. Equipment setup and verification
2. Medium preparation and temperature equilibration
3. Sample placement in basket tubes
4. Test initiation and monitoring
5. Endpoint determination criteria
6. Result recording

### Acceptance Criteria

Define pass/fail criteria based on:

- Product specifications
- Pharmacopeial requirements
- Individual tablet vs. batch criteria

## Documentation Requirements

### Test Records

- Date and time of testing
- Sample identification
- Operator identification
- Equipment used (with calibration status)
- Results and observations

### Deviation Handling

Procedures for:

- Out-of-specification results
- Equipment malfunctions
- Retesting criteria

## Training Requirements

Ensure all operators are trained on:

- Equipment operation
- SOP procedures
- Safety precautions
- Documentation requirements
