Wet sieve analysis is essential for materials that cannot be accurately analyzed by dry methods. Electromagnetic sieve shakers enhance this technique significantly.

## When Wet Sieving is Required

### Problem Materials

- Powders that clump or agglomerate
- Materials carrying static charge
- Fine particles below 50 microns
- Hygroscopic materials

### Applications

- Pharmaceutical excipients
- Food ingredients
- Mineral processing
- Chemical analysis

## How Wet Sieving Works

### Basic Process

1. Sample is suspended in liquid (usually water)
2. Suspension is poured onto sieve stack
3. Liquid carries particles through appropriate meshes
4. Fractions are collected and dried for weighing

### Electromagnetic Enhancement

The RSS-1 with wet sieving kit provides:

- Controlled spray nozzle for consistent liquid flow
- Collection outlet for efficient fraction recovery
- Vibration to prevent mesh blinding
- Reproducible results

## Advantages of Electromagnetic Wet Sieving

### Improved Separation

Three-dimensional vibration helps particles find mesh openings even in liquid suspension.

### Reduced Analysis Time

Efficient vibration combined with liquid flow speeds separation of difficult materials.

### Better Reproducibility

Controlled parameters ensure consistent results across analysts and laboratories.

### Prevented Clogging

Vibration keeps mesh openings clear, especially important with fine materials.

## Practical Considerations

### Liquid Selection

- Water for most applications
- Solvents for water-sensitive materials
- Surfactants to improve wetting

### Sample Recovery

- Careful drying of fractions
- Accounting for dissolved material
- Mass balance verification

### Equipment Care

- Thorough cleaning after wet sieving
- Proper drying of sieves
- Regular mesh inspection

## Quality Considerations

Wet sieve analysis requires:

- Validated procedures
- Trained operators
- Proper documentation
- Regular equipment verification
