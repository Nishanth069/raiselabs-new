The Antibiotic Zone Reader is a sophisticated instrument that revolutionizes how we perform antibiotic potency testing in pharmaceutical and microbiological laboratories.

## The Science of the Inhibition Zone

When an antibiotic is placed on an agar plate inoculated with a specific microorganism, it diffuses into the medium. If the microorganism is susceptible to the antibiotic, a clear zone of inhibition forms where bacteria cannot grow. The diameter of this zone is directly proportional to the concentration (potency) of the antibiotic.

## Why Precision Matters

Traditional manual measurement using calipers or rulers is prone to human error, parallax issues, and inconsistency between operators. The Digital Antibiotic Zone Reader eliminates these problems by providing:

- **High Resolution**: Measuring zones with accuracy up to 0.01 mm
- **Uniform Illumination**: Ensuring zone edges are clearly visible and reproducible
- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Digital displays make the process faster and more comfortable

## Compliance with Pharmacopeial Methods

Our Antibiotic Zone Readers meet requirements of major international standards:

- **USP**: General Chapter <81> on Antibiotics—Microbial Assays
- **BP (British Pharmacopeia)**: Appendix XIV on Biological Assay of Antibiotics
- **EP (European Pharmacopeia)**: Section 2.7.2 on Microbiological Assay
- **JP (Japanese Pharmacopeia)**: Antibiotic potency testing methods

## Key Features of Raise Lab Zone Readers

- **Advanced Optics**: High-quality magnifying lenses for sharp zone edge detection
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple calibration and data entry
- **Data Integrity**: Options for printing and secure data storage supporting GMP requirements

The Antibiotic Zone Reader is indispensable for laboratories involved in antimicrobial research or quality control.
