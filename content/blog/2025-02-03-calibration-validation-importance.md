Calibration and validation of analytical instruments are fundamental quality assurance activities in pharmaceutical laboratories.

## Calibration vs Validation

### Calibration

The process of comparing instrument output to known standards and adjusting if necessary to ensure accuracy.

### Validation

Documented evidence that an instrument consistently performs its intended function according to specifications.

## Why Both Are Essential

### Regulatory Compliance

Required by:

- GMP regulations
- Pharmacopeial standards
- ISO quality systems
- FDA expectations

### Data Reliability

Ensures:

- Accurate test results
- Reproducible measurements
- Defensible quality decisions

### Product Quality

Supports:

- Consistent manufacturing
- Batch release decisions
- Patient safety

## Calibration Best Practices

### Reference Standards

- Use traceable, certified standards
- Maintain proper storage conditions
- Replace before expiration

### Frequency

- Based on manufacturer recommendations
- Risk assessment considerations
- Historical performance data

### Documentation

- Complete records of all activities
- Before and after values
- Technician identification

## Validation Requirements

### Installation Qualification (IQ)

Verify proper installation and configuration.

### Operational Qualification (OQ)

Demonstrate equipment operates correctly across operating ranges.

### Performance Qualification (PQ)

Prove equipment performs consistently for intended applications.

## Ongoing Requirements

### Periodic Review

- Assess calibration data trends
- Review validation status
- Update as needed for changes

### Change Control

Document and assess impact of:

- Equipment modifications
- Software updates
- Method changes
