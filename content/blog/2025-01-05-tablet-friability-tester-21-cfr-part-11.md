While hardness testing measures the force required to break a tablet, friability testing measures how much a tablet crumbles or wears away under mechanical stress. It simulates the friction and impact tablets experience during coating, packaging, and transport.

## The Friability Test Procedure (USP <1216>)

A standard friability test involves:

1. **Weight Initial**: Weighing a sample of 10 or 20 tablets
2. **Rotation**: Placing them in a rotating drum (Roche Friabilator) for 100 rotations at 25 RPM
3. **Weight Final**: Removing dust and weighing the tablets again
4. **Calculation**: Determining percentage of weight loss

**Acceptance Criteria**: For most tablets, weight loss of not more than 1% is acceptable.

## Calibration Parameters

- The drum must rotate at a fixed speed of 25 ± 1 rpm, verified using a tachometer
- Fall height measured using a scale must align with 6.3 ± 0.2 mm standard
- Standard test duration involves 100 rotations (4 minutes at 25 rpm)

## The Importance of 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance

The FDA's 21 CFR Part 11 regulation sets standards for electronic records and signatures:

- **Audit Trails**: Every test and parameter change logged with timestamp and user ID
- **User Access Control**: Multi-level password protection (Admin, Supervisor, Operator)
- **Secure Data Export**: Results exportable to secure formats like PDF

## Equipment Types

There are three types of tablet friability testing machines:

- **Single drum devices**: Test one batch at a time
- **Double drum devices**: Test two batches simultaneously
- **Triple drum devices**: Maximum throughput for high-volume testing

The RFT-1V and RFT-2V Friability Testers meet rigorous pharmacopeial standards including USP <1216>, EP <2.9.7>, and JP <14>.
