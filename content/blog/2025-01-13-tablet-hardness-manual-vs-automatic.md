A Tablet Hardness Tester checks the mechanical integrity of tablets. The hardness is closely linked to disintegration and dissolution characteristics.

## Manual Tablet Hardness Testers

Manual testers require the operator to place each tablet individually and initiate the test.

**Advantages:**
- Lower initial cost
- Simple operation
- No power requirements for some models
- Suitable for low-volume testing

**Limitations:**
- Time-consuming for large batches
- Subject to operator variability
- Limited data recording capabilities

## Automatic Tablet Hardness Testers

Automatic testers feature motorized operation and can test multiple tablets with minimal operator intervention.

**Advantages:**
- High throughput
- Reduced operator fatigue
- Consistent testing conditions
- Integrated data logging and statistics
- 21 CFR Part 11 compliance options

**Features of Modern Automatic Testers:**
- Auto-loading mechanisms
- Multi-parameter testing (hardness, thickness, diameter)
- Statistical analysis (mean, SD, min/max)
- Printer and computer connectivity

## Load Cell Technology

Both manual and automatic testers now commonly use load cell technology, which:

- Provides precise and repeatable measurements
- Reduces variability in quality control
- Requires less frequent calibration than mechanical systems
- Converts mechanical force to electrical signals for digital display

## Choosing the Right Tester

Consider:
- Testing volume requirements
- Budget constraints
- Data integrity needs
- Regulatory compliance requirements
