Regular calibration of tablet hardness testers is essential for maintaining accurate, reliable quality control measurements.

## Calibration Importance

Load cell calibration services ensure equipment adheres to legal and quality requirements. Incorrect measurements can lead to product defects, financial losses, or safety hazards.

## Key Parameters to Calibrate

### Force Measurement

The primary calibration involves verifying the load cell accuracy:

- Use certified reference weights
- Test at multiple points across the measurement range
- Compare readings to known standards
- Adjust or replace load cell if outside tolerance

### Jaw Movement

Verify consistent jaw travel and positioning:

- Check speed of compression
- Verify parallel alignment
- Ensure smooth, consistent motion

### Thickness Measurement

For testers with integrated thickness gauges:

- Use calibrated gauge blocks
- Verify accuracy across range
- Check for wear on measuring surfaces

## Calibration Procedure

1. **Preparation**: Clean equipment and allow temperature stabilization
2. **Zero Verification**: Confirm zero point without load
3. **Low-Range Check**: Test at lower end of measurement range
4. **Mid-Range Check**: Test at typical operating range
5. **High-Range Check**: Test at upper limit
6. **Documentation**: Record all results and adjustments

## Maintenance Methods

Regular maintenance ensures continued accuracy:

- Clean jaws to remove tablet fragments
- Replace batteries in portable units
- Inspect load cell connections
- Verify software/firmware updates

## Calibration Frequency

- Daily: Zero verification
- Weekly: Quick accuracy check
- Monthly: Full calibration verification
- Annually: Complete calibration with certification

## Documentation

Maintain calibration records including:

- Date and technician
- Standards used
- Results before and after adjustment
- Next calibration due date
