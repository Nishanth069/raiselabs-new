Tablet dissolution testing is one of the most important quality control tests in pharmaceutical manufacturing, providing critical information about drug release and bioavailability.

## Fundamental Principles

### What is Dissolution?

Dissolution is the process by which a solid substance enters into solution. For pharmaceutical tablets, it measures how quickly and completely the active ingredient is released into a liquid medium.

### Why Test Dissolution?

- Predicts in vivo drug release
- Ensures batch-to-batch consistency
- Supports bioequivalence claims
- Monitors stability over shelf life

## Testing Equipment

### USP Apparatus Types

Different apparatus types suit different dosage forms:

- **Apparatus 1 (Basket)**: Capsules, beads, floating forms
- **Apparatus 2 (Paddle)**: Most tablets
- **Apparatus 5 (Paddle Over Disk)**: Transdermal patches
- **Apparatus 6 (Cylinder)**: Large transdermal systems

### Key Components

- Dissolution vessels
- Temperature-controlled water bath
- Paddle or basket assemblies
- Sampling systems
- Analytical detection

## Test Parameters

### Temperature

Standard: 37°C ± 0.5°C (body temperature simulation)

### Medium

Selected based on:

- Drug solubility
- Physiological relevance
- Regulatory requirements

### Agitation

Typical speeds: 50-100 RPM depending on method

### Sampling

Time points mapped to create dissolution profile

## Regulatory Framework

Pharmacopeial requirements from USP, EP, JP, and IP guide method development and acceptance criteria establishment.

## Data Interpretation

### Dissolution Profiles

Graphical representation of percent dissolved vs. time reveals release characteristics.

### Comparison Metrics

f1 (difference factor) and f2 (similarity factor) compare profiles mathematically.

## Quality Control Application

Routine testing verifies every batch meets specifications before release to market.
