Understanding the mechanisms of tablet disintegration is fundamental to formulating effective pharmaceutical products.

## Primary Disintegration Mechanisms

### Swelling

Many disintegrants work by rapidly absorbing water and swelling. This creates internal pressure that breaks apart the tablet structure. Common swelling-type disintegrants include croscarmellose sodium and sodium starch glycolate.

### Wicking (Capillary Action)

Wicking promotes water penetration into the tablet matrix through capillary channels. This facilitates contact between water and hydrophilic excipients throughout the tablet.

### Deformation Recovery

Some disintegrants undergo deformation during compression and recover their shape when hydrated, creating disruptive forces within the tablet.

### Particle Repulsion

Certain disintegrants generate electrostatic repulsion forces between particles when hydrated, contributing to tablet breakup.

## Super Disintegrants

Modern pharmaceutical formulations often employ super disintegrants that act through multiple mechanisms:

- **Croscarmellose Sodium**: Primarily swelling
- **Crospovidone**: Wicking and swelling
- **Sodium Starch Glycolate**: Swelling with high water uptake

## Sensitivity Factors

Super disintegrants show sensitivity to:

- **Temperature**: Elevated temperatures during processing can affect performance
- **Compaction Pressure**: Excessive compression force may inhibit disintegrant function
- **Moisture**: Storage conditions impact disintegrant effectiveness

## Modern Measurement Techniques

### Visual Observation

Standard USP method using basket-rack assembly to determine complete disintegration time.

### Texture Analysis

Measures force required to penetrate hydrating tablets, providing quantitative disintegration data.

### Video Imaging

High-speed cameras capture the disintegration process for detailed analysis.
