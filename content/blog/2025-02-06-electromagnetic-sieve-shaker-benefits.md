Electromagnetic sieve shakers represent a significant advancement over traditional mechanical shaking methods for particle size analysis.

## How Electromagnetic Shakers Differ

### Drive Mechanism

Traditional mechanical shakers use motor-driven eccentric weights. Electromagnetic shakers use electromagnetic drive units that convert electrical energy into controlled vibrations.

### Vibration Characteristics

Electromagnetic shakers create three-dimensional throwing motion causing material to move evenly over the entire sieving surface. This provides superior separation compared to simple circular or tapping motions.

### Frequency

Electromagnetic drives oscillate at high frequency, typically 3,000-3,600 vibrations per minute, far exceeding mechanical systems.

## Key Benefits

### Improved Accuracy

Consistent, precise shaking motion enhances the accuracy and reliability of particle size measurements through:

- Better separation efficiency
- Reduced sample loss
- Greater reproducibility

### Faster Analysis

High-frequency vibration speeds up the separation process, reducing analysis time while maintaining accuracy.

### Lower Maintenance

Fewer moving parts than mechanical shakers means:

- Less wear and tear
- No lubrication requirements
- Longer operational lifespan

### Quiet Operation

Electromagnetic shakers operate with minimal noise and vibration, creating a better laboratory environment and reducing mechanical interference with results.

### Adjustable Parameters

Users can precisely control:

- Amplitude (typically 0.5-3.0 mm)
- Duration
- Interval timing to prevent mesh blinding

## Applications

Electromagnetic sieve shakers excel in:

- Pharmaceutical granule sizing
- Food product analysis
- Chemical powder testing
- Material science research
- Quality control applications

## Choosing an Electromagnetic Shaker

Consider:

- Sieve sizes needed (100mm, 200mm)
- Stack capacity requirements
- Wet vs dry sieving needs
- Regulatory compliance requirements
