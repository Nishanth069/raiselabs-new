Calibration is fundamental to maintaining the accuracy and reliability of tablet hardness testers in pharmaceutical quality control.

## Why Calibration Matters

### Measurement Accuracy

Regular calibration ensures the load cell and measurement systems provide accurate readings, preventing:

- False pass results for weak tablets
- Unnecessary rejections of good tablets
- Inconsistent quality data

### Regulatory Compliance

Calibration is required for:

- GMP compliance
- Regulatory inspections
- Quality system certifications

### Product Quality

Accurate hardness data ensures:

- Consistent product performance
- Proper disintegration and dissolution
- Patient safety

## Calibration Components

### Load Cell Verification

- Test against certified reference weights
- Verify linearity across measurement range
- Check for drift or hysteresis

### Dimensional Measurements

For testers with thickness/diameter functions:

- Calibrate using gauge blocks
- Verify accuracy at multiple points
- Check for wear on measuring surfaces

### Display and Recording

- Verify displayed values match standards
- Check data recording accuracy
- Validate software calculations

## Calibration Frequency

### Recommended Schedule

- Daily: Zero verification before use
- Weekly: Quick accuracy check
- Quarterly: Full calibration verification
- Annually: Complete calibration with certification

### Trigger Events

Recalibrate after:

- Equipment repair or maintenance
- Physical impact or damage
- Relocation of equipment
- Suspect readings or OOS results

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain records of:

- Calibration procedures used
- Reference standards with traceability
- Results before and after adjustment
- Technician identification
- Next calibration due date
