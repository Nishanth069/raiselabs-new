Dissolution testing can be performed using manual or automated sampling approaches, each with distinct advantages.

## Manual Offline Sampling

### Process
1. Operator manually withdraws samples at specified times
2. Samples transferred to containers for analysis
3. Analysis performed separately (UV, HPLC)

### Advantages
- Lower equipment cost
- Flexibility in sample handling
- Simple to implement

### Limitations
- Labor intensive
- Subject to timing variability
- Potential for sampling errors

## Online Sampling Systems

### Process
1. Automated sample withdrawal at programmed times
2. Direct transfer to analytical system
3. Real-time result generation

### Advantages
- Precise sampling times
- Reduced operator involvement
- Consistent sample volumes
- Faster turnaround

### Limitations
- Higher initial investment
- More complex setup
- Requires compatible analytical equipment

## Key Differences

### Timing Accuracy

Online systems provide superior timing accuracy with samples withdrawn within seconds of programmed times.

### Labor Requirements

Manual sampling requires constant operator attention while online systems run unattended.

### Data Quality

Online sampling reduces variability introduced by human factors.

### Throughput

Automated systems enable higher throughput by freeing operators for other tasks.

## Choosing the Right Approach

Consider:

- Sample volume requirements
- Analytical method compatibility
- Budget constraints
- Throughput needs
- Regulatory requirements
