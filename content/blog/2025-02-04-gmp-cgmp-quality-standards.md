Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and current GMP (cGMP) are quality standards essential for pharmaceutical manufacturing and laboratory operations.

## Understanding GMP/cGMP

### GMP Definition

Good Manufacturing Practice encompasses guidelines ensuring products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards.

### The "c" in cGMP

"Current" signifies that manufacturers must use up-to-date systems and technologies to comply with regulations.
