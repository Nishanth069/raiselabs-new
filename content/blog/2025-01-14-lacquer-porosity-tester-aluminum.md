Lacquer porosity testing is critical for ensuring the coating integrity of metallic packaging used in pharmaceutical and food industries.

## What is Lacquer Porosity Testing?

The process involves detecting void spaces or porosity in wax-coated metallic vessels. This ensures the coating is strong enough to protect contents and prevent interaction between the metal and product.

## How the RLP-1 Works

The apparatus uses DC potential, a copper electrode, and chemical solution to test porosity that can be read through a digital display.

**Testing Process:**
1. Sample is connected as one electrode
2. Copper electrode serves as the counter electrode
3. DC current is passed through the electrolyte solution
4. Current flow indicates areas of poor or no lacquer coverage
5. Results displayed digitally for accurate reading

## Applications

Ideal for testing lacquer porosity across:

- **Aluminum Tubes**: Pharmaceutical and cosmetic packaging
- **Cans**: Food and beverage containers
- **Bottle Caps**: Closure integrity testing
- **Foils**: Blister packaging components

## Key Features (RLP-1 Model)

- Requires just 10 samples for efficient testing
- Programmable precision allowing users to set test duration
- Internal timer for consistent test periods
- Results displayed on 20X4 LCD display
- In-built thermal printer for comprehensive reports

## Regulatory Standards

Testing follows specific rules that ensure the object's coating is strong enough to protect contents. This is essential for manufacturers in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries.
