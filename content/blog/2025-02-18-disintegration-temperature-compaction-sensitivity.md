Super disintegrants are critical for rapid tablet disintegration, but their performance can be affected by processing conditions.

## Common Super Disintegrants

### Croscarmellose Sodium

- Cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose
- Works primarily by swelling
- Typical use level: 1-5%

### Crospovidone

- Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone
- Works by wicking and swelling
- Typical use level: 2-5%

### Sodium Starch Glycolate

- Modified starch
- High swelling capacity
- Typical use level: 2-8%

## Temperature Sensitivity

### During Granulation

Elevated temperatures can:

- Partially activate disintegrants prematurely
- Reduce swelling capacity
- Affect final tablet performance

### During Drying

Excessive drying temperature may:

- Damage disintegrant structure
- Reduce effectiveness
- Increase disintegration time

### Recommendations

- Monitor granulation temperature
- Use appropriate drying conditions
- Validate temperature effects during development

## Compaction Pressure Sensitivity

### Over-Compression Effects

High compression force can:

- Compact disintegrant particles
- Reduce water penetration pathways
- Delay disintegration onset

### Under-Compression Effects

Insufficient compression may:

- Result in friable tablets
- Cause premature disintegration
- Affect dissolution uniformity

### Optimization

Balance hardness requirements with disintegration performance through compression force studies.

## Formulation Strategies

### Disintegrant Selection

Choose based on:

- Processing conditions
- Drug properties
- Release requirements

### Concentration Optimization

Determine optimal level through:

- Disintegration time studies
- Dissolution profile comparison
- Stability assessment

### Processing Controls

Implement controls for:

- Temperature monitoring
- Compression force limits
- In-process testing
